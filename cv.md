3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
   Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
   learning new things from everywhere etc.).

6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
   freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
